# Project Feedback + Evaluation

Good job on Project 1.  A good, solid project.

## Project Workflow:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?


**Meets expectations:**
Good job using many, small commits.  Decent readme.  It starts a little rough, just dropping me into User Stories, with no header.  Did you follow them?  Only tackling the next story, once the current one was complete?  Your "Approach" sounds like ok, but it doesn't give me confidence that you understand what you did.  I hope it worked well for you.  

The file extension on your readme (.md) indicates that it is formatted using markdown.  Github will automatically parse markdown to html prior to rendering.  Check it out: https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/


## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations:**
You did what was required, coding and deploying a web application.

For future projects, please do not clone the GA project repo.  Start with a fresh `git init`.  It makes grading harder and there's no benefit (no starter code, no solution, etc).  Our instructions were not clear on this.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations:**
You code has decent organization and uses semantic names.  Good job grouping your code into methods, it's pretty self-documenting.  You have a bit of commented out code, please clean up as you go.

Make sure to take a look at the inline code comments I made in this [diff request](https://github.com/mattscilipoti/wdi8-project1-ln/compare/gh-pages...feedback_mms).

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets requirements:**
I think this is a good example of answering the need presented.  It's not exactly what you envisioned.  That's ok.  The first iteration rarely is.

## Unsolved Problems

> One of my unsolved problem is stoping the extra question and answer loop.

Why are you getting the "undefined" question and answer?  I added a console.log that may help with this.
